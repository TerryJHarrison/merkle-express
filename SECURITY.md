## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can email tjharrisonjr@gmail with `[MERKLE]` in the subject for any 
security enhancements or concerns. Expect a response back within a week, 
any bugs will gladly be addressed.

I do not have the funds to offer a meaningful bug bounty but will happily 
give credit for any identified bugs and/or accepted fixes if desired.
